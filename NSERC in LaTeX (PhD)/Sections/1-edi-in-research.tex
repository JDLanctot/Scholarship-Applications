The nature of the study does not directly involve human subjects or social dynamics that would necessitate specific EDI considerations in its design or methodology. The research questions, methodologies, and data analysis are grounded in objective mathematical and computational principles that are inherently neutral with respect to equity, diversity, and inclusion factors. The dissemination of results will follow standard scientific practices of peer-reviewed publication and open-access data sharing, ensuring equal accessibility to the scientific community. While EDI considerations are crucial in many research contexts, they do not directly impact the core elements of this particular study.
