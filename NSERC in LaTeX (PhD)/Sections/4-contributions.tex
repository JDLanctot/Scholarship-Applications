\textbf{Most significant contributions to research and development}\\
\textit{Network Defense (Undergraduate Thesis):} This research explored the capacity of Artificial Intelligence to learn features about networks, such as the Power Grid, and how hiding information about such networks from AI can limit network vulnerabilities. This work is significant as it laid the foundation for my current PhD research on network robustness. It demonstrated the potential of using AI techniques to attack critical infrastructure networks and how heuristic defenses were ineffective -- yielding important implications for cybersecurity and network resilience. My role involved developing the AI models, conducting simulations, and analyzing the results. This work was entirely my own, conducted under the supervision of my undergraduate advisor.

\textit{Mitochondrial network dynamics research (Accepted):} This ongoing research investigates how mitochondrial network structure impacts protein and molecule distribution. Using advanced simulation techniques, we've shown that well-connected and dynamically faster networks enhance particle spread, with branching networks formed through end-to-side fusion achieving optimal distribution. This work is significant as it provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of cellular function, potentially impacting our understanding of mitochondrial diseases and aging processes. As second author, my primary contributions include contributing to the data analysis of the generated networks and manuscript preparation.

\textit{Next.js eCommerce open-source contribution :} As a top contributor to this popular eCommerce framework, I've played a crucial role in enhancing its functionality and stability. This project, with over 5.1k stars on GitHub, is significant as it simplifies the development of dynamic and user-friendly eCommerce websites, potentially impacting thousands of businesses and developers worldwide. My contributions include implementing new features, optimizing performance, and collaborating with a global community of developers. This work demonstrates my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world applications and my commitment to open-source software development.

\textbf{Applicant's statement}\\
\textit{Research experience:} Throughout my academic career, I've developed strong skills in computational modeling, machine learning, and network analysis. My undergraduate thesis on Network Defense provided me with hands-on experience in applying AI techniques to complex network problems. This work honed my abilities in developing and implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of network security.

My ongoing PhD research has further expanded my expertise in deep reinforcement learning, complex systems modeling, and data analysis. I've gained proficiency in using tools such as Python, PyTorch, Julia, and MATLAB for large-scale simulations and data processing. My work on mitochondrial network dynamics has enhanced my skills in analyzing computational models of complex biological systems.

\textbf{Relevant activities}\\
\textit{Awards and Distinctions:} I've received several prestigious awards, including the NSERC grant in 2023 (\$17,500) and 2021 (\$12,000), the Connections in Science award (\$1,000), and during undergrad was on the Dean's List for three consecutive years (2019-2022).

\textit{Academic Excellence:} During my graduate studies, I achieved a 4.25 cumulative grade point average (on a 4.33 scale). This result, coupled with my consistent placement on the Dean's List during undergrad, demonstrates my strong academic performance and dedication to my studies.

\textit{Presentations:} I've presented my research at multiple conferences, including the Complex Systems Day (2022-2024), APS March Meeting 2023, and CUPC 2021, showcasing my ability to communicate complex scientific ideas to diverse audiences.

\textit{Leadership:} As VP of Finance for PGSU in 2024, I've developed strong leadership and organizational skills, managing budgets and financial planning for a graduate student organization.

% \textit{Open Source Contributions:} My significant contributions to the Next.js eCommerce project and the Scientific Computing Installation repository demonstrate my ability to apply research skills to practical problems and my commitment to the broader scientific and developer communities.

\textit{Interdisciplinary Collaboration:} My work on various projects, from network security to mitochondrial dynamics, showcases my ability to work across disciplines and apply computational methods to diverse scientific problems.
