  Scholarship Applications
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Scholarship Applications is a collection of files that show the content and styling of how I submit for grants -- such as NSERC. Hopefully, this might be helpful in helping you be successful in obtaining similar grants. Also I have directly included some other templates for academic success, linked at the end of this document.

## Scholarship Applications

Filling out documents for scholarships and grants can be a time-consuming process. These files are documents that can help you get up and running quickly, give you help in formatting, and can give you context of the content it should likely include.

- The word-docs folder contains the word documents to make a similar application for yourself.
- The exported-pdfs folder contains the pdfs of the word-documents and the CCV is a pdf exported from the [CCV website](https://ccv-cvc.ca/indexresearcher-eng.frm), and it needs to be created on this website.
- The Submission.pdf is the collection of all of these documents, as they were submitted within the NSERC portal for a successful submission.
