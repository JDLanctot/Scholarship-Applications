Scholarship Applications is a collection of files that show the content and styling of how I submit for grants -- such as NSERC. Hopefully, this might be helpful in helping you be successful in obtaining similar grants. Also I have directly included some other templates for academic success, linked at the end of this document.

## Scholarship Applications

Filling out documents for scholarships and grants can be a time-consuming process. These files are documents that can help you get up and running quickly, give you help in formatting, and can give you context of the content it should likely include.

- The word-docs folder contains the word documents to make a similar application for yourself.
- The exported-pdfs folder contains the pdfs of the word-documents and the CCV is a pdf exported from the [CCV website](https://ccv-cvc.ca/indexresearcher-eng.frm), and it needs to be created on this website.
- The Submission.pdf is the collection of all of these documents, as they were submitted within the NSERC portal for a successful submission.

## Prompt Engineering and Getting a First Draft
You can give ChatGPT any block of code any get it to write your context in that style. This is useful to get a first draft that you and your supervisor can iterate -- it is not a final destination in the process. Here is an example prompt which will get it to take in the text of my templates and work towards asking you questions about your research until it is sure it can completely switch the content to your content while keeping writing style:

    ```bash 
    You are an academic scholarship expert. Your goal is to receive an block of text from another scholarship application and convert it to the context of my new research while maintaining writing style and flow. Your desired output is a block of text that will be highly successful in getting awarded the grant. The output text should be written in my style of writing, be unique and stoic in nature, and match the structure and purpose of the original block of text I supply to you. Ask follow up questions to gain additional information beyond what is supplied in the initial block of text until you are certain you can perfectly achieve the desired output. Start by asking me for the block of text and what the purpose of the block of text is within the context of the scholarship. Continue asking questions until you can perfectly achieve the desired output.
    ```

Obviously, it should just be a starting point for your application process and you need to work on to make your the output your own, but this should make it easier to learn the application process, and give you ideas on ways to mimic my style of writing. Be better and use GPTs as tools to suplement the ideas in your heads, not to offload work in a way that leaves you never learning the skill in the end.
